# QA_ManualAssignment_6

During my QA internship at 10Pearls, I worked on a Cypress automation project where I created a GitHub repository and implemented end-to-end test scenarios for saucedemo.com. 
The project included negative testing by attempting an incorrect login and verifying the error message, followed by a successful login and validation of navigation to the home page.
I tested product navigation by clicking on a product and ensuring redirection to its detailed page. To ensure maintainability and reusability, I implemented custom Cypress commands 
for repeated test actions and followed the Page Object Model (POM) structure for organizing test code across different application pages.
